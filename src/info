/*
Exports - named exports, default exports

Named Exports:
exports {}, the {} is not for an object but is the syntax for exports
or
export const square (a) => a*a but variable declaration has to be there, export "Something!" is invalid
Example:
const square = (a) => a*a;
export {square};

or

export const square (a) => a*a

To import,
import {square} from "<relative path>"

Default exports:
Example:
const square = (a) => a*a;
const add = (a,b) => a+b;
export {square, add as default} is valid

or

export const square = (a) => a*a;
const add = (a,b) => a+b;
export default add;

or

export default (a,b) => a+b;

export {square as default, add as default} is invalid as there can be only one default export

To import,
import add, {square} from "<relative path>"
Default imports can be called anything, i.e in the example it can be import import a, {square} from "<relative path>"
